# Neo Vanilla: Yet Another Vanilla Modpack

Welcome to **Neo Vanilla**, born from the collective creativity of a group of friends who simply adored Vanilla Minecraft. What started as an intimate endeavor to enhance our own Minecraft experience has blossomed into an open-source modpack we're thrilled to share.

## Key Features:

- **Ambiance Overhaul**: Dive into a Minecraft world enriched with superior audio, captivating sounds, immersive ambient backdrops, and striking shaders. Each moment is crafted to feel vivid and alive.
  
- **Fluid Animations**: Our passion for detail drove us to introduce more fluid animations, making the Minecraft universe move with unprecedented grace.
  
- **New Structures & Biomes**: Venture into freshly designed biomes and uncover distinct structures, all while staying true to the Vanilla essence we all cherish.

- **Others**: Many other mods such as [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), [Remove Reloading Screen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rrls), to improve the experience navigating in the game before joining your world.

## Open Source & Community-Driven:
**Neo Vanilla** is open source. We'd like to see how the mod pack evolves with collective input.

- **Note**: This Modpack has also been tested with many other mods including famous ones such as Physics Mod and looks working for a lot of them. But feel free to report bugs if you encounter them when adding new mods on your side. We'd like to add more if they match the spirit of the Modpack.
