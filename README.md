- **Fluid Animations**: Our passion for detail drove us to introduce more fluid animations, making the Minecraft universe move with unprecedented grace.
  
- **New Structures & Biomes**: Venture into freshly designed biomes and uncover distinct structures, all while staying true to the Vanilla essence we all cherish.
